# Antarctica Biodiversity Competition

### EG-ABI Data visualisation competition: “Impacts of climate change around Antarctica and the Southern Ocean” 

Diatoms are an important group of single-celled algae. In total they are resposible for approximately 20% of marine primary productivity. 
Several diatom species are the dominant groups in polar waters, and can survive and even thrive in sea-ice. 

Decreases in sea-ice may be having an influence on the number of species of diatoms in the Southern Ocean - in this data visualisation we show diatom species richness (the number of species present) from 2007 to 2021, using data collected through AusCPR. 

Sea ice extent data are from the National Sea and Ice Data Centre ([NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index)). 

Data for diatom species richness are from the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder ([AusCPR](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/29b28617-c91c-4bc9-b3aa-c97960a8b5c8)), we filtered this dataset below 55 degrees latitude.
