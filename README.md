Diatoms are an important group of single-celled algae. In total they are resposible for approximately 25% of marine primary productivity. 
Several species of diatoms thrive in polar waters, and can survive in sea-ice. 

We used data from 



Sea ice extent data are from the National Sea and Ice Data Centre ((NSIDC)[https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index]). 

Data for diatom species richness are from the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR)[https://www.gbif.org/dataset/29b28617-c91c-4bc9-b3aa-c97960a8b5c8], we filtered this dataset below 55 degrees latitude.
